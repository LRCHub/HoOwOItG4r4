[00:00.99] He knows about you in every way
[00:04.23] He's memorized every part of your face
[00:07.78] Inside and out, baby, head to toe
[00:11.11] Yeah, he knows everything there is to know
[00:32.11] 
[00:13.96] Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
[00:17.55] The songs that you sing when you're all alone
[00:20.86] Your favourite band, the way that you dance
[00:24.52] But baby, baby
[00:31.52] 
[00:28.45] Does he know you can move it like that? Whoa
[00:34.83] Does he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh
[00:41.82] Tonight, you're mine, baby
[00:48.94] Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
[00:55.30] Does he know?
[01:01.80] 
[00:59.30] I catch your eye, then you turn away
[01:03.11] But there's no hiding the smile on your face
[01:06.42] Inside and out, baby, head to toe
[01:09.83] He's not around, girl, you let me know
[01:28.83] 
[01:12.80] Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
[01:16.28] The songs that you sing when you're all alone
[01:19.77] He knows how you dance in front of your friends
[01:23.15] But baby, baby
[01:30.15] 
[01:26.80] Does he know you can move it like that? Whoa
[01:33.73] Does he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh
[01:40.64] Tonight, you're mine, baby
[01:47.76] Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
[01:54.09] Does he know?
[02:00.59] 
[01:57.18] He'll never know the way you lie when you look at me
[02:01.60] So, keep trying, but you know I see
[02:04.69] All the little things that make you who you are
[02:09.56] So, tell me, girl
[02:18.06] 
[02:11.74] Does he know you can move it like that?
[02:18.99] Does he know that you'll never go back? Whoa
[02:40.99] 
[02:25.79] Does he know you can move it like that? Whoa
[02:32.44] Does he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh
[02:39.30] Tonight, you're mine, baby
[02:46.36] Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
[02:52.79] Does he know?
